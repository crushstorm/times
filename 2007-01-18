The cabinet's decision drew sharp criticism from opposition parties, which termed it as \"unconstitutional, undemocratic and unethical\" and vowed to prevent Musharraf's re-election.Hardline Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) leader Liaquat Baloch said, \"We will make every effort to stop the re-election of Musharraf.\"Spokesman Farhatullah Babar of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), headed by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, said, \"It is a mockery of democracy to say that a parliament in its dying days has the right to impose on the people a president for the next five years when it is not in place.\" said.Announcing the cabinet's decision, Information Minister Mohammad Ali Durani said, \"Hopefully, the present assemblies will complete their term and since the tenure of the president expires on November 15, his re-election will be sought from the present assemblies in accordance with constitutional provisions.\"He, however, did not say whether Musharraf would also continue to hold the post of army chief.Baloch, a senior leader of the Jamat-e-Islami, said the government's decision would bring opposition parties closer for a joint struggle against dictatorship. \"The cabinet decision shows the country is not run by the cabinet but by agencies,\" he said.During the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, the cabinet was briefed on constitutional and legal aspects of presidential elections by experts led by Aziz's senior advisor Sharifuddin Pirzada, a confidante of Musharraf.The President's current five-year term will end almost a week before the completion of the tenures of the assemblies on November 16, 2007.\"The cabinet was told that as per the constitution, the assemblies would complete their term on November 16. The president should be elected between September and October 2007 and the interim set-up will be put in place in line with the constitutional provisions,\" Durani said.The announcement on seeking Musharraf's re-election follows a conference of Crops Commanders held on January 16, which was addressed by him. The re-election was reportedly discussed at the meeting.Musharraf also discussed the issue with members of the cabinet at a dinner hosted by Aziz on last Friday.The decision was a forgone conclusion because under Article 41(1), the president's tenure will expire on November 15 and he needs to be re-elected before October 15 as rules say polls should be held 30 days before the end of his term.All ministers of the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), a key ally in the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q, were conspicuous by their absence at the cabinet meeting.Musharraf's election in a referendum in 2002 was endorsed by the current assemblies after general elections the same year.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

Authoritative sources in SP said Mulayam would prove his majority on January 25 and remain the CM till polls.But observers are still speculating how differently he could use his proven majority. They feel Mulayam could just prove the numbers game to settle the question of Central rule for good. It may just make it a tad difficult for the Centre to use the Raj Bhavan.Congressmen are, however, also debating other options, aware that the wily Yadav chieftain would not give away a game so intricate, so easily.With the Centre and SP sparring for ruler's chair in UP during polls to eke out the 'incumbent's advantage', CM could take Congress by surprise by recommending the dissolution of the assembly to become a caretaker CM during elections.The caretaker CM theory is backed by the suggestion that it would render the Supreme Court verdict on BSP defectors'\"irrelevant\".It is, however, fraught with a risk as it would leave it to the governor to take a call on post-dissolution scenario.Given the relations between the government and the governor, imposition of Central rule over giving the reins to Mulayam as caretaker CM is a bigger possibility.Will the CM go for a third option: To prove his numbers and then seek the dissolution of the House, with the hope that Centre removes him and takes over in the run-up to polls.Mulayam may well do that, if he has begun to feel the heat of incumbency and wants a rival in charge.While the SP is still to reveal its cards, Mulayam's maze of a mind has turned the imagination of his rivals fertile.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

But relief could be around the corner with the P P Srivastava committee recommending relaxation in height and floor restrictions norms.The report, submitted to urban development ministry on Tuesday, is likely to be accepted by the Centre and may then clear the way for a liberalised regime without restrictive conditions which, in turn, would encourage further commercialisation in lal dora villages. The committee allows rural and urban villages extensive mixed land use norms like in other parts of the city.\"There is no reason why villagers who have plots within lal dora, adjoining major roads, should be denied opportunity of exploiting a favourable location to their advantage, in the same way as an owner of similar premises outside the lal dora area,\" a committee member said.The committee has taken the view that villagers should also get the fruit of urbanisation. And, like in other development plans, paucity of land in the Capital and sky-rocketing plot prices have been seen as rationale for liberalisation of norms in villages.On building bylaws, the committee has said that relaxation from compulsory registration should remain. At the same time, the panel has called for computerisation of land records so that compulsory registration loses its relevance.Committee sources said that in cases where residential plots were being used purely for residential purposes, no building plan sanction would be required, as was the case earlier. However, the report has been questioned as well. One of the members on the committee, Naini Jayseelan, is yet to sign the report. D D Mathur, another member, gave his assent after some delay.The committee has also recommended development of villages through public-private partnership, which will open the gate for private builders for land pooling and redevelopment.The committee is also understood to have directed urgent preparation of local area plans and also asked for a special task force to look into the development process in villages. There is a rider though. Like in master plan proposals, civic infrastructure in these villages should be upgraded keeping in mind pressure of population.\"The main idea is that villages be upgraded, with all necessary basic services, and then be integrated into the urban fabric of the city,\" said a source in the committee. In a bid to regulate growth and commercialisation in the Capital's rural belt and adhere to suggestions made by the Tejinder Khanna committee, the UD ministry has set up an \"expert committee\" to recommend special building bylaws for lal dora and its extended areas. At present, no such building bylaws exist for the rural areas of Delhi.The Khanna committee had recommended that all existing showrooms or guest houses on major public roads be regularised in view of the general policy view of allowing non-residential activity along such roads.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

But Felix again proved a hard nut to crack as he brought off a diving save off Martins.The scene shifted to the other end and Dempo keeper Satish had to block a hot-blooded shot from Dudu, before the referee made a blunder in awarding a free-kick inside the box on Sporting defender Raymond.The resultant free-kick was scored by Robert De Silva to allow Dempo score the eqaliser.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

Imagine a Shilpa Shetty-Big Brother controversy on Indian TV and you get the picture.Internationally, regulatory bodies are the norm. The United Kingdom has Ofcom (Office of Communications), set up in 2003, which is a \"super regulator\" that monitors content on television, radio and telecommunication networks.It was to Ofcom that the over 10,000 viewers wrote to to complain against the 'racist bullying\" of Shilpa Shetty on Channel 4's Celebrity Big Brother series. As per norms, on receiving a complaint Ofcom asks the broadcaster for a copy of the programme, seeks the view of the broadcaster and examines whether the programme was in breach of the broadcasting code.Ofcom's counterpart in the US is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), an independent agency that regulates radio and television broadcasts. FCC's most famous crackdown was in February 2004, when it fined the broadcaster over Janet Jackson's \"wardrobe malfunction\" that occurred during the halftime show of Super Bowl.In India, there is no one agency empowered to receive viewer complaints or take action against objectionable content on television.Following a judgment by the HC last year, all films shown on TV are required to have a 'U' or 'U/A' certificate from the censor board. TV serials and programmes are, however, outside the purview of the order.So when a couple of years ago some women wanted to file a complaint against the serial Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi for apparently endorsing sex determination tests, there was nowhere to go. Even the Cable Television and Network Act seems to pass on the responsibility to the police. Under the Act, the DGP can issue orders to seize the equipments of cable operators if they are screening objectionable material. There is no recourse against broadcasters registered outside India.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

The tribunal however declined to take the affidavit because it was on the verge of delivering its verdict.When a CAT Bench gave its decision on September 8, it turned out to be a split verdict. One of the members attacked Centre for not responding to CAT's notice during the proceedings.In view of the split verdict, a third member of CAT, Manoranjan Mohanty, is hearing the case afresh. This allowed the state to make a fresh attempt on January 12 to put the Centre's affidavit on record.However, Sreekumar's counsel Navroz Seervai objected to the state's effort to push the unfiled affidavit. Since Centre's counsel corroborated Seervai's version, Mohanty refused to take the August 30 affidavit on record.The mystery of the affidavit remains unresolved. How did Centre come to back Modi government in sidelining Sreekumar? Joint secretary (police) in home ministry, B N Gaur, when contacted, declined to answer.Asked why it has so far not bothered to file a revised affidavit, Gaur took refuge in a technicality: CAT did not issue a fresh notice to the Centre for the second round of hearing.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

The party, he said would also go amongst the people on this issue.Continuing his tirade against the Congress party, the minister said that the SP has welcomed UPCC president Salman Khurshid's observation that the Congress has withdrawn support and will sit in the opposition in the Vidhan Sabha.He said while the SP will continue supporting the Congress at the Centre and the UPCC president's observation has only validated what the SP had been saying all through.The party, he said had always maintained that the Congress and the BJP were hand-in-glove. He said the SP wants that the Congress should vote with the BJP on the motion of thanks to the governor's address so that its contention on the two being hand-in-glove proves true.Laughing at the Rashtriya Lok Dal's statement that many SP MLAs were coming to RLD, the minister said the SP's appeal to the Election Commission was to hold the elections on time. He said there should be no cause for delay as the voters list was ready and the observors had send their report.On the issue of actress Shilpa Shetty and the racist comments made against her, Agarwal said it was again a manifestation of the Centre's weak policies that the Indians had to face such denegrating comments.Earlier, Shivpal announced the joining of SP by sitting BSP MLA Bhupinder Singh who is representing Binawar (Badauan). Former three-time MLA from Kher (Aligarh) Jagveer Singh also announced his joining of SP. Singh was formerly with the RLD.In response to a query on the Congress's remark that the SP was paying for the advertisement for UP done by Amitabh Bachchan, the general secretary said the party was not paying for it.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

He was accompanied by his lawyers.After being convicted by the TADA court for the illegal possession of an AK-56 assault rifle and a pistol, Dutt had sought bail in order to complete pending film assignments and make some arrangements for his daughter, Trishala, who is studying in the US. He, subsequently, sought an extension of the bail which was granted by the court.Dutt, who faces between five and ten years in jail after being found guilty under the Arms Act, has also sought an exemption from a prison sentence under the Probation of Offenders Act.The court is also likely to hear the arguments on the quantum of sentence for seven others convicted in the multiple blasts case.Over 100 persons have been convicted by the court for their involvement in the conspiracy to engineer 13 bomb explosions in the city on March 13, 1993, killing 257 people and injuring over 700.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

The prospective deal has been the talk of military aviation circles for several months now.But having announced that it is in the market to buy 126 Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA), New Delhi is now taking its own sweet time to put out what is called a Request for Proposal.Arms mavens think India has deliberately delayed the RFP because it wanted vendors to pitch there wares at the air show.Boeing, which has built strong commercial ties in India, is pitching hard to sell the F-18 Super Hornets, a jet that is only in service with the USAF and has not been sold to any other country.The plane has not flown anywhere outside US except at the Farnborough Air Show, a Boeing official said. Boeing is also lining up the rejuvenated P-8A weaponised maritime surveillance planes, mid-air refuelling tankers, and T-45 Goshawk trainer jets for sale.But Lockheed Martin's future depends on selling its F-16s, one of the worlds most popular fighter jets. Only Washington's recent decision to sell more F-16s to Pakistan is keeping the planes last assembly line in Texas running.Boeing and Lockheed, like all American arms makers, share an unusual relationship. They are rivals in a sense, but they also collaborate on many projects, such as the one for the F-22 Raptor Stealth Fighter.The F/A-18 itself is a piecemeal jet the airframe is made by Boeing IDS and Northrup Grumman, the engine by General Electric and the radar by Hughes.Beneath the veneer of civility and cooperation, US arms companies are only too ready to shoot each other down without taking aim. The lucrative Indian market has set of a frenetic race between them.As the ongoing transfer of the US navy ship USS Trenton shows, American military wares are also not taboo any more for India, if the price and terms are right.The Trenton deal was clinched in a record time less than two years from the time New Delhi first made the call in March 2005.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

There are no fruit-bearing trees there so we could plant them there and this would prevent the monkeys from going out of the Ridge area.\"This is not all. The government is still banking upon the old idea of first catching the monkeys, rehabilitating them in a temporary shelter and then transporting them to another state that has a forest area or some wildlife.Unfortunately for Delhi, all the states, including Haryana and Rajasthan, have already refused to take on the Capital's Simian burden. However, the government is undeterred. It is in the process of expanding the capacity of already existent temporary shelter at Rajokri by 100%. It can house 300 monkeys now. A new shelter with a 400 capacity will be opened at Bakhtawarpur.Dadoo himself hopes that something can be done. The secretary lives near the Ridge and faces a harrowing time as 50 monkeys cross through his house every morning leaving behind a trail of much plunder. So it is over to you to bail out the government. Put on your thinking caps and see if you want to adopt a monkey or suggest opening a sanctuary for them. But think fast as the Delhi High Court has set a deadline for the government.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

Thirty-eight ships, big and small, raced to help the tens of thousands in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka.But when the ships reached there, they found piers and jettys wrecked. Although the Navy overcame myriad obstacles to bring off a stupendous relief act, one which was universally hailed, \"It was also a moment when we felt an acute need for an amphibious landing ship,\"said a commander.That gaping hole in the Indian armada was filled to a large extent on Wednesday when the Indian Navy took charge of USS Trenton, a massive amphibious loading dock, in an elegant handing over ceremony at the Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia.The 17,000-tonne vessel will be the second largest ship in the Indian Navy after the aircraft carrier Viraat, and the first American ship to join the Indian fleet.Officials say the ship, which is still undergoing repairs and refurbishing in Norfolk, will be in the US till May before it leaves for India, where it is expected to join the Eastern Naval Command in Vishakapatnam.In a charming coincidence, US ports will also be getting a look once again in May at the Indian Navy's INS Tarangini, one of the world's most admired tall (sailing) ships, that won both praises and prizes during a visit here in 2005.But with it's six H-3 Sea King transport helicopters and an assortment of smaller boats, the Trenton flotilla, which will be formally commissioned into the Indian Navy as INS Jalashva (Sanskrit for seahorse), is in a different league altogether.It is expected to expand India's aspiring blue water Navy to enable both troop movements and relief and rescue on both sides of the subcontinent.As of Wednesday, the vessel was formally decommissioned from the US navy, and a full complement of more than 300 Indian sailors and 27 officers led by Commodore B S Ahluwalia (VSM) took charge.They have already been in Norfolk for several weeks now literally learning the ropes about one of US's most trusted vessels.Trenton was commissioned in 1971 and has seen action in Lebanon and Somalia among other places, landing US troops and rescuing American citizens.New Delhi purchased the ship for a $ 48.44 million. The Trenton experience may lead New Delhi to consider other US purchases.The catch: Each of the US navy's two dozen aircraft carriers is a humongous vessel. Most of them are in the 100,000 tonne range, are nuclear powered, and cost in the billions.They are considered way above both India's requirement and affordability.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

(Agencies Photo)ABOARD THE USS TRENTON/INS JALASHVA: When an 18-member team from the Indian Navy boarded USS Trenton in Spain last October for a recce prior to its purchase by India, an American crew member sent home a cable that declared: \"They speak English!\"The exclamatory remark was just one indication of the military chasm between the two countries despite the recent thaw that has seen them overcome half a century of Cold War baggage and ignorance. From getting used to gauges that measured in Fahrenheit and gallons and pounds per sq. inch, to figuring out how to get the bread machine to crank out chapattis, the Indians too faced a few challenges.But on Wednesday, after nearly six months together at sea and in port during which they thrashed out every issue including which key fits which locker, some 650 sailors and officers from both sides exchanged warm goodbyes in wintry conditions as the Americans debarked Trenton one last time to transfer the ship to the Indian Navy.At a colourful ceremony on board the enormous vessel berthed in Pier No.5 at Norfolk, Virginia, with the Honors Bos'n playing the pipes and the navy band playing Ruffles and Flourishes and the Admiral's March, LDCR Donegan ordered the lowering of the ensign and the US colours. Rear Admiral Hall presented the transfer certificate to Commodore Murugesan, turning the ship over to the India.Minutes later, after brief speeches that seemed to last an eternity in sub-zero temperatures, Captain BS Ahluwalia ordered his men to relieve the Americans of watch and hoisting of the Blue Ensign. And thus, USS Trenton became INS Jalashva, the latest acquisition of the Indian Navy and first American ship to join the Indian fleet.The transfer brought to a close months of camaraderie and kinship between officers and sailors of the two navies as they worked towards a 'hot transfer' of the ship that will remain in Norfolk till May for a makeover. But when it is formally commissioned into the Indian Navy later this year, it will augment India's blue water capability enormously.Just how much is evident in the very name that New Delhi has chosen for Trenton: Jalashva, which contrary to earlier reports, does not mean sea horse, but a 'river horse' -- a euphemism for the hippopotamus. Indeed, like the hippo, the ship opens an enormous maw leading to a cavernous belly -- a two tiered well --the size of a football field. It can hold four large vessels (imagine a hippo pregnant with quadruplets) besides an assortment of tanks and guns, not to speak of 1500 fully loaded men and six choppers. From keel to mast, the ship about eleven storeys tall.\"It's massive,\" explains Lieutenant Commander Iftikhar Alam, a proud seaman of erect bearing who is braving the freezing with just his handsome uniform and warm manners. \"In Lebanon, it alone could have done the job it took three Indian vessels to do.\"Indeed, deployed in Lebanon recently, Trenton rescued 15,000 Americans -- a feat Admiral Hall recalled with pride while wondering what the heck were so many doing holidaying in a war zone.At 36 years old, Trenton is not exactly in spanking good shape. Rusty might be an exaggeration, but it needs plenty of working on. But that, explains an Indian officer, is again part of the cultural difference between the two sides: the Americans are more into operational aspects than spit and polish.\"Come back in May before we sail home,\" he says. \"You will see an entirely different ship.\"", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

And yet, they have not lost hope of finding him alive one day.Their hopes are now pinned on the movie 'Parzania \u2014 Heaven and Hell on Earth' slated for release on January 26.The film, directed by Rahul Dholakia, features actors Naseeruddin Shah and Sarika in a sensitive portrayal of the couple, who survived the bloodshed at Gulbarg Society where 39 people were killed, only to die a thousand deaths, endlessly waiting for their son who is missing ever since.On Thursday, Roopa and Dara, a projectionist in a local movie theatre, along with their daughter Binaifer paid an emotional visit to their home at Gulbarg Society with Naseeruddin and Sarika to shoot promotional material for the film.\"I want the entire country to see this movie. One never knows... There might be someone who has met my son, seen him somewhere... The movie will have Azhar's photograph and our cell phone number so that people can contact us,\" an emotional Roopa told TOI. \"I also want the people to know what happened that day, the horrors we suffered,\" said Roopa.She has still not forgotten how the entire family had huddled in former Congress MP Ehsaan Jafri's house for safety on February 28, 2002.\"I was holding Binaifer's hand who in turn was holding Azhar. As the fire raged, we thought it fit to run out. In the commotion, Azhar's hand slipped and he ran out alone. Overwhelmed with fear, I passed out. When I regained consciousness,my son was nowhere to be found. His body too was not found,\" says Roopa.Ever since, the desperate parents have left no stone unturned to find their son. They routinely paste Azhar's posters on trains, buses, outside remand homes, orphanages and even police stations.\"We often visit the civil hospital and mental hospital and peep into general wards, just in case our Azhar has been admitted there,\" says Roopa.The couple is desperately waiting for the movie's release. \"We firmly believe that Azhar is alive.

Many of them are only for propaganda or to win cheap publicity,\" says former Chief Justice of India V N Khare. \"They do nothing more than clog the already overburdened justice delivery mechanism,\"he says.The reality, however, doesn't seem to have dawned on those wielding the gavel and the fight against illogical cases has been limited periodic expression of anguish by the Supreme Court.The latest was on January 9 when it ticked off courts against admitting frivolous PILs, while imposing hefty fines on two litigants. Last year, too, the then Chief Justice of India had asked courts to \"discourage frivolous litigation and impose heavy costs on litigants who bring them whether it be individuals, corporations or governments.\"But all this has not had any serious effect so far. \"Despite all the noise, there has not been any study on the subject as courts here are not open to research.The judiciary too has not made any attempt to come out with the statistics and suggest a remedy,\" says K N Chandrasekhara Pillai, director of Delhi-based Indian Law Institute.A large number of cases have been brought to courts in the recent years over alleged obscenity. That too when there is still enough ambiguity on what constitutes obscenity.In most cases, almost nothing comes out of them. Says senior Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the recent petition against the director, producer of blockbuster Dhoom 2 and its actors Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai over a lip-lock scene in the movie, \"The matter doesn't deserve to be in court. Its a frivolous issue.\"The only existing provisions under the Indian laws to check frivolous litigation are in the 1976 Code of Civil Procedure and the Consumer Protection Act of 1986. But the fine prescribed under the CPC is a mere Rs 3,000 while the maximum set by COPRA is Rs 10,000.Experts agree that this should be raised if it's to work as a deterrent. Like in some developed countries, lawyers could also be asked to do a status check on the clients and the facts of the case before they take it up.There are some who advocate sterner measures. \"Merely imposing costs or fine will not suffice. Courts should start awarding prison terms for those who abuse the system,\" says Justice Khare.\"Some guidelines should also be laid down regarding Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, dealing with writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and high court, so as to discourage mischief makers,\" he adds.As of now, only courts can check the menace, says Pillai. \"The only way out would be for them to further tighten the screening process so that silly matters, which only eat up their time, are dismissed out right.\"The question of frivolous litigation, as distinct from vexatious litigation, had also caught the attention of the Law Commission of India.In its 192nd report on Prevention of Vexatious Litigation, the panel, headed by former Supreme Court Judge M Jagannadha Rao noted, \"while a vexatious litigation would mean habitually filing cases on issues which have already been decided or against the same parties or their successors, a litigation may be frivolous without any persistent filing, if it has no merit whatsoever or is an abuse of the process of the court.\"Given this difference, the Law Commission also decided it would give two reports analysing the scenario and prescribing remedies. \"But due to the paucity of time, we could not give a report on preventing frivolous litigation,\" Justice Rao told TOI.Though there is a school of thought that higher court fees would deter frivolous litigation, this hasn't found much favour.The predicament emerged as back as in 1975 during the enactment of the Bengal Regulation Act, which was the first known piece of legislation in pre-independent India prescribing higher court fee as a check against frivolous and vexatious litigation.Lord Macaulay, who was heading the Law Commission then, had opposed the measure saying it would scare away genuine litigants. In 1996, the Supreme Court also stated the need to tackle frivolous and vexatious litigation separately and not by way of an increase in court fee.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

Outraged by a programme on AXN, 'World's Sexiest Commercials', the government on Wednesday got into the moral policing act and banned the channel until March 15.In the past, the government might have growled, even barked at 'poor taste' on TV, but it has never bitten off the channel.The I&B; ministry, which was the government's sword arm in decapitating AXN, said the programme was against 'good taste or decency' and was adversely affecting 'public morality'. Only a few days ago, the ministry had ordered two TV channels to apologise for a tasteless Gandhi video.AXN is primarily an action channel and was broadcasting the sexy ads programme late at night, after 11 pm. According to those who have watched it, these are creative ads with sexual imagery and overtones, although rarely exposing too much skin. In that sense, it was adult stuff because it required an adult sensibility to react to the programme.There are some other channels which show bikini-clad women in their late night programmes. Many other channels show movies that have sexual references or imagery. Which raises the question whether the government has been selective in its action against AXN.Interestingly, the proposed broadcast Bill recommendations allow adult programming after 11 pm. So, the axe on AXN would appear to be going against the spirit of the recommendations. I&B; minister P R Dasmunsi, while announcing the ban, said the broadcast Bill would be brought to Parliament in the Budget session and would address issues of programme content.Said Dasmunsi: \"It has been decided to prohibit transmission or re-transmission of the channel up to March 15, with immediate effect.\" Only once before has the government taken such drastic action \u2014 against a Russian semi-pornographic channel, but never against a popular mainstream channel.Taken aback by the action against AXN, adman Prahlad Kakkad said: \"Who are they (politicians) to preach us on morality? It is for the people to decide what they wish to watch or not to watch.\" Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt said the government was behaving like a \"paranoid mother\".

Passengers would not be given a ticket and rather overcharged. The behaviour of the attendants, too, was improper as they would use abusive language and menacingly hold onto a car window while waiting for their money.But now the parking lot outside the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport here looks different. Parking attendants are clad in dark blue uniform and facilities, too, have been streamlined. The words \"parking lot\" are embossed in white on the back of the parking attendants' blue shirts. A woman passenger had once complained of being harassed by an attendant who was merely clad in a vest and a pair of trousers. She said, \"He was being very rude and when I told him that I will complain, he promptly climbed on my car's bonnet and sat there. Finally, he went away after I complained to an officer of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) deployed there.\"This passenger is relieved with the new look of the parking lot. \"Now whenever I park my vehicle, there is an attendant in uniform with his identity card hanging around his neck. I always get a ticket and am able to move away after paying the exact fee,\" she said.Patna airport director Atul Dikshit said, \"We had received a few complaints from passengers about the parking lot facilities. Although it has been outsourced, the contractor has now provided a set of uniforms and identity card to each attendant.\" Dikshit said, \"This move will prevent any unauthorised person from collecting parking fee. Besides, the identity card will give the passenger an opportunity to identify the attendant and lodge a complaint, if needed.\"Meanwhile, the CISF security check at the very entry of the airport complex has prevented unauthorised persons from simply entering into the complex. A food joint has also been opened near the parking lot which has proved to be very useful. With flights being majorly delayed, families and individuals waiting to receive their passengers are seen sipping hot beverages from this joint.Dikshit said soon an electronic barrier would also be installed in the parking lot which would prevent vehicles from moving out without paying the fee. The barrier would be fixed at the exit. Only after a vehicle has paid the fee, the attendant would punch a button to press a lever to activate the barrier. Another passenger said, \"The parking lot has definitely improved. But the main approach outside the airport building needs to be decongested. Everybody parks his car on this road, thus jamming it. Like other airports in the country, no car should be allowed to remain parked on this approach road. Cars should at best pick up their passengers or drop them quickly and move on.\"", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

The allotment letters to selected IT/ITeS companies will be issued in due course\".This welcome development for north Karnataka comes nearly eight months after the IT Investors' Meet held here in May last year to project Hubli as a Tier-II investment destination for IT/ITeS sector in view of the overstretched civic infrastructure and land scarcity in Bangalore.Soon after the investors' meet, HDMC had set apart the land for IT/ITeS companies through a resolution unanimously adopted at its council meeting. Implementing the resolution, it had sent the proposal to the government in July 2006 for its approval.But initially, the finance and urban development departments objected that the HDMC land couldn't be allotted at a pre-determined price. In case it is to be alienated, it has to be through open auction and not by allotment. Only the government can overrule this provision, it was contended.Later, former law minister and opposition leader in the legislative council, H K Patil, wanted the same land at Rayapur in between Hubli and Dharwad to be alloted for the proposed Karnataka Law University, expected to become functional from the next academic session.The HDMC's IT land allotment committee had originally recommended 25 acres of land each to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Quest. But TCS declined the offer saying its requirement was 50 acres, and that too in an IT-specific SEZ. Quest also backed out after waiting for five months.The HDMC later recommended the allotment of land declined by TCS to some other IT/ITeS firms. The better known among them are the Bangalore-based electronics software design company Sankalp Semiconductor, and NS Infotech, a BPO start-up operating from Hubli.It is learnt that the selected companies were being offered land at Rs 10 lakh per acre.

He disturbs her when she tries to take an afternoon nap. He makes fun of her weight consciousness.He calls her \"bacche churane wali moti budhiya\" though she neither old nor fat. In one episode, when his mother asks for a chocochip, Shin Chan refuses. \"Itni kanjoosi tumne kahan se sikhi,\" his mother asks. The kid replies, \"Tumhi se, mom.\"Such mischievous antics have made Shin Chan almost a cult figure among kids. For them, he is a fantasy fulfiller. The number of kids of age group 4-14 who saw Shin Chan in December '06 was 32,91,000. The show had a reach of 36% making it the most watched programme on the Hungama channel.Bhavini Sinha, 7, watches the same episode again and again. \"She even apes some of his antics. She pronounces the word, Ohhhh, the way Shin Chan does,\" says mother Lalita.And Pakhi's grandmother, Sarbani Roy, says the five-year-old child often coerces her mother into accepting her demands. \"Otherwise she says, I will call you names the way Shin Chan does,\" says Sarbani.And that's what worries parents such as Pratibha Mehrotra. \"Shin Chan seems to be setting the wrong example. I know of parents who have stopped their kids from watching the programme,\" she says.They are not the only ones complaining. Over the past few months, clinical psychologist Rajat Mitra has seen a group of children in the age group of three to five years watch the programme and observed their behaviour.\"Shin Chan shows you can be smarter than adults and even fool them. His naughtiness is exciting and gives kids a sense of high by which they can become equal to adults,\" he says.Mitra says that conventional parenting is process-oriented. \"In real life, if you want something, you ask for it and learn to negotiate. But Shin Chan shows them how to bypass the process,\" he says.The psychologist has instructed the kids not to watch the programme unless accompanied by an adult. \"An adult must explain them what is right, and what's not. The programme stops their ability to discriminate between right and wrong,\" he says.But Aparna Bhosle, vice-president, programming and production, Hungama TV, offers a different view.\"In every story his parents reprimand Shin Chan whenever he misbehaves and his naughtiness always gets him into trouble,\" she says.The senior executive adds: \"We interact with a lot of children.

Is it that nature has cut them to size?Evolution has never fashioned a lion or wolf the size of an elephant. Nor is it likely to, because such a \"super-carnivore\" would be unable to catch prey fast enough to fuel the energy demand of its enormous body, researchers conclude.\"As a mammalian carnivore, you can only be so big,\" says Chris Carbone, a carnivore biologist at the Institute of Zoology of the Zoological Society of London, UK.Carbone and colleagues sifted through the published literature for estimates of daily energy intakes and expenditures for different sized species of carnivorous mammals, reports NewScientist.Not surprisingly, they found that larger carnivores used more energy, with every doubling of body size causing a roughly 1.6-fold increase in energy needs.The carnivores fall into two distinct groups. Those smaller than about 15 kg to 20 kg tend to eat rodents, insects and other prey items much smaller than themselves, while those larger than this threshold tend to eat prey of roughly their own size or even larger.Hunting and killing these large prey takes a lot of energy, however more than twice as much, after accounting for the predator's body size. Moreover, the researchers noticed that the largest carnivores within each of the two feeding strategies seemed to be having difficulty getting enough to eat.Both the largest small-prey feeders, such as the aardwolf, and the largest big-prey specialists, such as lions and polar bears, spend much of their time conserving energy by resting or moving slowly, and their total rates of energy intake and expenditure tend to be lower than expected given their body size.Small carnivore species can still evolve larger body sizes by switching to the high-cost, high-payoff strategy of catching big prey, but large carnivores have no higher, even-better-paying strategy to switch to, they conclude.Extrapolating from this, Carbone's team predicts that carnivores should be unable to make a living at body sizes greater than about 1000 kg.Sure enough, the largest carnivore known from the fossil record, the short-faced bear, weighed in at 800 kg to 1000 kg, and the largest living species, the polar bear, averages just a little smaller.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

However, the list will not include King Gyanendra of Nepal, who on Monday lost his status as ceremonial head of state after the promulgation of a new constitution.The two-day celebrations, to be held at New Delhi's Gwalior House, will have a typically Rajput-Rana ceremony on the first day when the groom will come to the bride's house and be garlanded.Called the 'swayamvar', it is reminiscent of the ancient Rajput tradition in which the bride chooses her own man from an assembly of kings and princes. It will be an apt ceremony since this is a love match after all.The 'swayamvar' will be followed by a comparatively simple lunch, where only family members will be present, after which the groom returns to his own house.The big bash is scheduled for 23 February when the 'barati' comes and is to be served a traditional feast of 84 dishes set out on silver and gold platters.Chefs from Avadh and Kathmandu will be flown in to prepare the food while some of the exotic foodstuff, like wild boar, will come from Nepal.On that day, the elaborate wedding rituals will include 'varani', where the groom is revered as Vishnu. It will be followed by 'hat chhat' when a white cloth is spread before the wedded pair, who have their hands smeared with saffron and then place them on the cloth, leaving a series of red-hand imprints.But, perhaps, the most breath-taking spectacle will be the bed-ritual. The bride and groom will be seated on a sumptuous bed after which her family members will first wash her feet in a silver basin and then her groom's, using the same water, to signify that she is being given to him.The wealth of the Ranas and Scindias has combined to produce a magnificent antique silver bed guaranteed to take the beholder's breath away.However, even after she gets married, Devyani will not quit her job at the UN. Its a sign that the times have changed, said a family member who did not want to be named.Today, even the best known and richest families need to work. This will be a new chapter in the life of the 34-year-old Devyani, who has passed through trying times since 2001, when Dipendra, the then crown prince of Nepal, reportedly killed his parents, King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, as well as his three siblings and other relatives, before turning the gun on himself.=========================UP moves SC against taking away 'gunners'Dhananjay Mahapatra | tnnThe Mulayam Singh government has moved the SC challenging an order of Allahabad HC directing cancellation of arms licence to student leaders.NEW DELHI: With assembly elections closing in, the Mulayam Singh Yadav government has moved the SC challenging an order of Allahabad HC directing cancellation of arms licence to student leaders and withdrawal of security cover to criminal elements.In a series of orders, the High Court ,taking note of an article in the Times of India, had directed the UP government to take steps to revoke the orders providing gunners to criminal elements.The HC had felt that providing uniformed gunners \u2014 originally meant to protect ministers, judges, MPs and MLAs for special reasons\u2014 to criminal elements and student leaders, was a misuse of tax-payers money and a drain on the police force.When the state argued that there could be genuine threat to the lives of student leaders, the Bench had said the threat perception could be considerably reduced \"if the state takes prompt steps to withdraw arms licence and initiates strict measures to confiscate illegal arms in possession of the student community\".", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

{"city": "norfolk, virginia", "code": "1262037", "title": "Indian Navy takes charge of US ship Trenton", "text": "NORFOLK, VIRGINIA: Within hours of the monstrous tsunami that struck the subcontinent's eastern flank in December 2004, the Indian Navy commandeered and dispatched nearly a fourth of its fleet for relief and rescue. Thirty-eight ships, big and small, raced to help the tens of thousands in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka whose lives were devastated by the calamity.But when the ships reached the tsunami-hit areas, they found piers and jetties wrecked. Although the Indian Navy overcame myriad obstacles to bring off a stupendous relief act, one which was universally hailed, ''it was also a moment when we felt an acute need for an amphibious landing ship,'' according to a commander who was involved in the operation.That gaping hole in the Indian armada was filled to a large extent on Wednesday when the Indian Navy took charge of USS Trenton , a massive amphibious loading dock, in an elegant handing over ceremony at the Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia. The 17,000 ton vessel will be the second largest ship in the Indian Navy after the aircraft carrier Viraat , and the first American ship to join the Indian fleet.Officials say the ship, which is still undergoing repairs and refurbishing in Norfolk, will be in the US till May before it leaves for India, where it is expected to join the Eastern Naval Command in Vishakapatnam.In a charming coincidence, US ports will also be getting a look once again in May at the Indian Navy's INS Tarangini , one of the world's most admired tall (sailing) ships, that won both praises and prizes during a visit here in 2005.But with its six H-3 Sea King transport helicopters and an assortment of smaller boats, the Trenton flotilla, which will be formally commissioned into the Indian Navy as INS Jalashva (Sanskrit for river horse or hippopotamus), is in a different league altogether. It is expected to expand India's aspiring blue water navy to enable both troop movements and relief and rescue on both sides of the subcontinent.As of Wednesday, the vessel was formally decommissioned from the US Navy, and a full complement of more than 300 Indian sailors and 27 officers led by Captain B S Ahluwalia (VSM) took charge. They have already been in Norfolk for several weeks now literally learning the ropes about one of America's most trusted vessels.Trenton was commissioned in 1971 and has seen action in Lebanon and Somalia among other places, landing US troops and rescuing American citizens. New Delhi purchased the ship for a $ 48.44 million, including choppers and boats, a prize that some officials said was a bargain. The ship is expected to serve in the Indian Navy for at least 15 more years.The Trenton experience could also lead New Delhi to consider other US purchases. The Indian Navy has long considered having at least three aircraft carriers in its armada. With the Russian carrier Gorshkov joining INS Viraat , there is some talk of having another carrier, particularly since Viraat itself, of 1945 vintage, is nearing the end of its life.The catch: each of the US Navy's two dozen aircraft carriers \u2013 a dozen in service and a dozen in reserve \u2013 is a humongous vessel. Most of them are in the 75,000-100,000 ton range, are nuclear-powered, and cost in the billions. They are considered way above both India's requirement and cost, even if they came at the cut rate price of Trenton .", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}

And so is a receding hairline.Moreover, baldness is striking the young in India. Hair loss, which was till recently believed to strike only after the age of 40, is now being reported in men and women in their 20s. Trichologists suspect stress to be an important factor behind this trend.According to them, stress has been found to aggravate conditions such as alopecia areata hair loss in patches and trichotillomania a compulsive behaviour that involves strong urges to pull hair. The trend has become more commonplace among women.Dr Barry Stevens, renowned British trichologist, said, \"More and more young men are complaining of baldness. That could mainly be due to stress. Stress juggles adrenaline levels in our body causing androgenic type of hair loss.Younger women have also been found to lose hair while dieting. The hair becomes thin all over their head. Androgenetic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness.\"Dr Akshay Batra, a trained trichologist from The Trichologist Society of London, who recently conducted a study on 1,000 women complaining of receding hairline, found that over 60% of them were low on iron intake, vitamins and protein.\"Long hours of fasting doubled with vegetarian food deprive women of proper nutrition. Long hours of work also lead to improper dietary habits. Anorexia or bulimia the two most common eating disorders among women wanting to lose weight also caused massive hair loss,\" he said.Experts said that hair grows by adding new proteins to the base of the strand, and pushing the strand up out of the hair follicle. The make-up of these proteins is influenced greatly by the nutritional state of the person, affected by eating habits.Emotional stress and illnesses cause massive hair loss. The body stops production of hair and devotes its energies toward repairing vital body structures. Sometimes, the hair loss and re-growth cycle can last six months when induced by physical or emotional stress.According to Dr Binod Khaitam, associate professor of dermatology at AIIMS, while young age baldness is commonly due to genetic factors, stress related hair loss is more common in women. Health conditions like mild anaemia or low blood count and thyroid abnormalities can manifest through diffused hair loss.Male-pattern baldness is characterised by hair receding from the lateral sides of the forehead, known as receding hairline. An additional bald patch may develop on top which is triggered by androgens like DHT.", "source": "toi", "date": "2007-01-18"}
